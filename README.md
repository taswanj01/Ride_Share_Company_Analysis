This project is a visual analysis of data from a fictional ride sharing company. The goal is to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.

First is a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

Average Fare ($) Per City
Total Number of Rides Per City
Total Number of Drivers Per City
City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)


In addition, there are three pie charts:

% of Total Fares by City Type
% of Total Rides by City Type
% of Total Drivers by City Type


Following is a quick written description of three observable trends based on the data.
