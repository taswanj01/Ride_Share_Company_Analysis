This project is a visual analysis of data from a fictional ride sharing company. The goal is to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.

First is a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

Average Fare Per City
Total Number of Rides Per City
Total Number of Drivers Per City
City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)


In addition, there are three pie charts:

Percentage of total fares, total rides, total drivers by city type.

Following is a quick written description of three observable trends based on the data.
